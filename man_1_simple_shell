simple_shell
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B simple_shell
.RI [ command ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
simple_shell is a basic shell that reads commands from the user or from standard input, executes them, and displays the results.
It can operate both in interactive mode and non-interactive mode.

Commands are executed using the system call execve() and will be looked for in the system's PATH.

The shell can execute commands that do not require arguments, and will print an error message if a command cannot be found.


.SH USAGE
In interactive mode, the shell will continuously display a prompt, wait for the user to enter a command, and execute it.

Examples:
.RS
$ ./hsh
$ ls
$ echo "Hello, World!"
$ exit
.RE

In non-interactive mode, commands can be passed to the shell through pipes or files:

Example:
.RS
$ echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
.RE

.SH EXIT STATUS
The shell exits with the following statuses:
.IP "0" 4
If the shell successfully executes the command.
.IP "1" 4
If an error occurs, such as when a command cannot be found.
