.SH NAME
simple_shell \- a simple UNIX shell implementation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B simple_shell
.SH DESCRIPTION
The simple_shell is a basic command-line interpreter for UNIX-like systems. It provides an interactive shell interface where users can execute system commands by typing them at the prompt.

The shell supports basic command execution but does not handle advanced features like pipes, redirects, or built-in commands.

.SH USAGE
To start the shell, run:
.B ./hsh

The prompt will appear, and you can type commands to be executed.

.SH COMMANDS
The simple_shell currently supports the following:

.TP
.B <command>
Executes the given command by searching the directories in the system's PATH variable. If the command cannot be found, it prints an error message.

.SH EXAMPLES
Run the shell interactively:
.TP
$ ./hsh
$ /bin/ls
$ exit

Run the shell in non-interactive mode:
.TP
$ echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
$ cat test_ls_2 | ./hsh
